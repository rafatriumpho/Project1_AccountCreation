# Account Creation System (Python)

This is my first Python project, built after one week of learning Python.
The program simulates a simple account creation system using the terminal.

## Features
- Asks the user for name, age, email, and password
- Checks if the user is 18 years old or older
- Saves user information to a text file
- Prints confirmation messages in the terminal

## What I Learned
- How to use variables
- How to get user input
- If/else conditions
- Basic validation
- Writing data to a text file
- Organizing a simple Python project

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer
2. Open a terminal in the project folder
3. Run the program using:
   python main.py

## Future Improvements
- Add better input validation
- Hide the password input
- Store data in a database instead of a text file
- Create a login system
